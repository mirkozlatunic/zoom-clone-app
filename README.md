👉 **Past Meetings List**: Access a list of previously held meetings, including details and metadata.

👉 **View Recorded Meetings**: Access recordings of past meetings for review or reference.

👉 **Personal Room**: Users have a personal room with a unique meeting link for instant meetings that can be shared with others.
